    <h1>How Was It?</h1>
    <p class="text-brand">Published on March 9th, 2025 by Emilio Marquez</p>

    <p>
      When you are 18 years old, it is not usually in your plans to start a new job. 
      You might just want to stay with your friends and continue enjoying their company, 
      as well as spending time with your family. Now, imagine being told there’s an opportunity 
      to work at Intel Corporation for one year with the <strong>Xeon</strong> Family of Server Processors. 
      Specifically, you’ll be contributing to the UEFI (formerly known as BIOS) by working on the 
      <em>Memory Training</em> part of the code.
    </p>

    <p>
      On my first visit to the <em>GDC Site</em>, I went there to submit my contract and personal documents. 
      While waiting for the laptop that Intel provides for my role, I met another new hire on the MRC Team. 
      We connected immediately once we discovered we’d be teammates. We joked about our laptops, since his was a bit smaller, 
      but he considered that an advantage because it was more portable.
    </p>

    <p>
      As a new hire at Intel, you receive help from a teammate known as a “Buddy.” 
      This person is there to guide you through your new role and make your ramp up smoother. 
      He typically teaches you the technical knowledge needed for your position like how to read a <em>JEDEC</em> standard 
      and which ones apply to your tasks. He also explains what BIOS or UEFI is, how the 
      <strong>MRC (Memory Reference Code)</strong> fits into UEFI, and introduces you to the concept of IFWI.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mt-5">My First Assignment</h2>
    <p>
      I still remember my first assignment involving the codebase. It was a feature ticket focused on cleaning up a header file. 
      I felt very nervous because I didn’t fully understand the code. It looked almost like a different language not quite C. 
      I spent nearly a month working on that ticket, knowing it would be challenging because, as my Buddy mentioned, 
      there was a lot of <em>“legacy code”</em> in the system.
    </p>

    <p>
      The term <em>“legacy code”</em> refers to code that lacks unit tests and hasn’t been updated for years. Only a few brave people attempt to modify it, 
      but with the right guidance, it’s possible. This cleanup was difficult because it contained duplicated or confusing functions and desperately needed a refactor. 
      Thankfully, I didn’t have to tackle it alone. As a newcomer, you don’t automatically have the best coding practices or a solid grasp of software design, 
      so you rely on help from more experienced teammates.
    </p>

    <p>
      While working on this cleanup, I met other engineers who had even more technical expertise than my Buddy. 
      I was amazed by their depth of knowledge. During a meeting, I listened to discussions among Tech Leads people responsible for the project’s quality, design, 
      and deadlines some of whom had over 15 years of BIOS development experience. 
      Hearing them talk ignited a desire in me to become one of those highly skilled engineers someday.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mt-5">The MRC México Team</h2>

      style="max-width: 400px; height: auto;"
    />

    <p>
      As I mentioned before, I received help from my Buddy, who was part of the <strong>MRC México Team</strong>, along with other members and my manager. 
      Everyone was very friendly and helpful, especially once they knew my age. They tried to make me feel comfortable so I could be productive in my role. 
      Being nervous can help you stay <em>cautious</em> when making changes, but it can also make you feel uneasy sometimes even paranoid about breaking something, 
      which isn’t always helpful.
    </p>

    <p>
      On Fridays, some team members would come to the site usually my manager, my Buddy, and sometimes the other new hire. 
      Other people there included my manager’s friends, who were either Principal Engineers or managers of their respective areas. 
      Several other teams, such as FPGA, Board, Memory, Power, and Signal Integrity, also worked on the same campus. 
      We had a tradition of taking a lap around the <em>GDC Site</em> after lunch, discussing weekly news or reminiscing about stories 
      from their time studying for a master’s degree at Cinvestav or other institutions, or even tales from their early days at Intel.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mt-5">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      If you are a new hire or someone with no experience in your recently acquired job not only at <strong>Intel Corporation</strong> 
      but at any company one of your first priorities should be to talk and socialize with your manager and new teammates. 
      A great engineer is not just the one who knows the most technical knowledge, codes the fastest, or closes tickets sooner than anyone else. 
      A great engineer is someone who understands their abilities, has control of their time, knows when they have the bandwidth 
      to work on something else, and recognizes the areas where they lack experience. They also know the people who do have that experience 
      and can ask them for help.
    </p>
    <p>
      Intel is not a single person company. It’s not that the CEO decides everything about the company, nor that a single engineer can do the work of many. 
      Intel is a company built on teamwork, where a student can become a great engineer thanks to the quality of the people working there. 
      Even if it’s not a good time for the company financially, it’s always a good time to build new talent, and Intel excels at doing so.
